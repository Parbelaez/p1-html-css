Welcome to my portfolio,

It is difficult for me to correctly show all my capabilities in a single CV, therefore, I decided to create a portfolio with all my working experience and hobbies with which I can make a living, or could be useful for the visitirs of the webpage interests.

## Concept for the UI / UX

As the portfolio is really eclectic, it should be as clear and simple as possible.

The logo was inspired by an AI generated one, from [LOOKA](https://looka.com/), but created totally manual using Google fonts and [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons

The color scheme is based on differnt shades of grey, with the exception of the tiles, that were thought as pastel, so their inherent opacity match the seriousness of the header and the footer.

### Fonts

Google fonts was the source of the typography:

[Poppins](https://github.com/itfoundry/poppins): is a geometric sans serif typeface developed by Indian Type Foundry and Jonny Pinhorn.

### Icons and images

Icons were used directly from [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

Images were obatained from my personal archive and [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)



## Content Pages

### index.html -landing page-

I chose to use a tiling system in the index to be similar to a mobile app, with an icon, title, catch phrase, and a brief description.

The footer is composed as well of icons of my normally used social networks the could help the user knowing more about my work.

### Engineering

This one was used to practice the usage of the background image, and the hover displaying and image on the word: probe

## Used Technologies

To apply the available technologies, the header and the footer where created using float, each tile was created using grid, and the main with flex. This can help also in copping with pre-automatization of the responsiveness.
